        <h3 class="recipe-desc">Description</h3>
        <p class="recipe-desc">I wish that I could eat 10,000 of these in one sitting. 4 simple ingredients, infinite amount of joy & flavor.</p>

        <h4 class="recipe-heads">Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>½ cup (129 g)</strong> creamy peanut butter</li>
            <li><strong>3 tablespoons</strong> unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
            <li><strong>¼ cup (31 g)</strong> confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li><strong>2 cups (364g)</strong> milk chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="recipe-heads">Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Line a standard 12-cup muffin tin with liners. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl add peanut butter, butter, and confectioners' sugar. Use a hand mixer on low and combine all of the ingredients. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Add the chocolate to a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in 20-second increments, stirring after every 20 seconds, until the chocolate is melted and creamy (about 1-2 minutes total).</li>
            <li>Add about 1 tablespoon of chocolate to the bottom of each muffin tin (only enough to fully coat the bottom of the liner). Top with 2 heaping teaspoons of the peanut butter mixture in the center. Add about 1 tablespoon of chocolate to the top of each cup. Carefully tap the muffin tin onto the counter to help the chocolate settle and smooth out the tops.</li>
            <li>Chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour, or until set, before serving.</li>
        </ol>
