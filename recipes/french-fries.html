        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Who doesn't like french fries? Nobody I want to know! Ha! <em>Haha!</em> Anyways, this recipe goes fairly hard. As the fish once said, rev up those fryers!</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>2 lbs (3-4)</strong> floury potatoes</li>
            <li><strong>2 tbsp</strong> white vinegar</li>
            <li><strong>1 tbsp</strong> cooking salt/kosher salt</li>
            <li><strong>1 litre</strong> canola/vegetable oil</li>
            <li><strong>Choose:</strong> Salt, shaker fries seasoning, or rosemary salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut: Peel the potatoes. Cut into 6 mm / 1/4" French fries using a serrated knife.</li>
            <li>Keep cut fries submerged in a bowl of water to prevent them from going brown while you cut the remainder. (No need for actual soaking beyond this.)</li>
            <li>Rinse: Transfer potatoes to a colander and rinse under tap water for 15 – 20 seconds.</li>
            <li>Simmer: Place fries in a large pot with 2 litres/quarts of cold tap water, vinegar and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat then immediately reduce stove to low so the surface is rippling gently (Note 5), not big bubbles. Cook for 10 minutes then carefully remove using a slotted spoon into a colander (do not tip into colander, fries will break).</li>
            <li>Dry 5 min: Spread the fries on 2 tea towel lined trays. Leave to steam dry for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pot: Pour 3 cm / 1.2" of oil in a pot that is at least 10cm/4" high</li>
            <li>Separate the fries into 3 Batches (for cooking).</li>
            <li>Heat oil to 205°C/400°F over medium high heat.</li>
            <li>Lower 1/3 of Batch 1 fries into the oil using a slotted spoon. WAIT 10 seconds, add another 1/3 of the fries, wait 10 seconds, then add the remaining Batch 1 fries.</li>
            <li>50 sec fry: Fry for 50 seconds, moving them around once or twice. Then remove with a slotted spoon onto 2 paper towel lined trays, spread out in a single layer. The fries will still be white and floppy.</li>
            <li>Repeat Fry #1 with Batches 2 and 3, ensuring the oil is back at 205°C/400°F before cooking.</li>
            <li>30 min cool: Leaves fries to cool for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Line a large bowl with paper towels – for draining and tossing.</li>
            <li>Fry #2: Heat oil to 205°C/400°F. Fry half the French fries for 4 minutes, moving them around twice, or until golden brown and crispy. Drain in the lined bowl, then repeat with remaining fries.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle fries with salt or seasoning or choice. Toss and serve!</li>
        </ol>
