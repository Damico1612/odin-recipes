# odin-recipes
My first HTML project

This project will demonstrate a basic website containing recipes, utilizing the HTML skills that I have learned so far. I will demonstrate my knowledge on using different types of headings, creating bold & italicized text, as well as images & links. I will demonstrate my beginner knowledge on GIT regarding cloning repositories, pushing & commiting. I will return to this file at the end of the project to reflect on how it went.

I have completed the project & enjoyed my time with it. I have been able to practice coding the foundational elements of webpages & gained a good understanding of how to create an html boilerplate. I now have a better grasp on what the process looks like when working on a project using git & github. I have learned how these basic html elements can be applied to stylize a webpage & create a smooth experience for the user. I never used to think of a website or server as essentially a collection of files & directories, so this has greatly improved my understanding of what is going on behind the scenes when it comes to websites.

A challenge that I faced while completing this project was my uncertainty on when to commit & push with git. I found myself struggling to determine what was best practice. I ended up mainly commiting after I had finished a new page, but I am unsure whether this was often enough. I felt that the work I was completing was very straight forward & perhaps simple, so I question the importance of my seemingly redundant commit messages in this scenario.
