# odin-recipes
My first HTML project

This project will demonstrate a basic website containing recipes, utilizing the HTML skills that I have learned so far. I will demonstrate my knowledge on using different types of headings, creating bold & italicized text, as well as images & links. I will demonstrate my beginner knowledge on GIT regarding cloning repositories, pushing & commiting. I will return to this file at the end of the project to reflect on how it went.
